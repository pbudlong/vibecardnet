# Supported Networks

Circle Gateway connects multiple blockchains, allowing you to move USDC between them and pay for resources gaslessly.

## 1. Batching Networks (Gasless Payments)

These are the networks where you can **make gasless payments** using this SDK.

| Network         | Chain ID  | Status  |
| --------------- | --------- | ------- |
| **Arc Testnet** | `5042002` | ✅ Live |

> **Note:** Batching support is rolling out to more networks soon.

## 2. Gateway Networks (Deposits & Withdrawals)

You can **withdraw** USDC from any of these networks into the Gateway.

**Why is this powerful?**
Once funds are in Gateway, you can **withdraw them to ANY supported chain instantly**.

- Deposit on **Arbitrum**.
- Pay for a resource on **Arc**.
- Seller withdraws earnings on **Base**.
